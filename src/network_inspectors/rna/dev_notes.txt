This inspector is still in experimental (work-in-progress) state.

The Real-time Network Awareness (RNA) inspector provides visibility into a network using
Passive Network Discovery (PND). RNA analyzes traffic to discover hosts on the network
and to detect operating system (OS) running on a host. It uses fingerprints for OS detection.
It logs ip/mac addresses, ports, protocols, OS, and other information about traffic running
on these hosts. It does not generate or alter traffic on its own.

RNA logs information it discovers by parsing TCP/UDP/IP/Link-layer protocols and observing
data found by other inspectors (e.g., monitoring application IDs, client versions,
user-agents found by appid or http inspectors). Operating systems have different signatures
which are apparent in different parameters in the packets that it sends. These parameters
include things like TCP window sizes, TCP options, segment sizes, etc. Such fingerprinting
information is provided to RNA as input so that RNA can analyze traffic.

RNA discoveries is stored in host tracker objects, which are saved globally in an LRU cache
and shared among threads. RNA memory and discovery are bounded by the memcap of cache.

Packets from untracked sessions (e.g., non-IP) are processed via the eval method as per
proto-bit registrations. Packets from tracked sessions (e.g., IP, TCP, UDP, and ICMP)
are processed via events as per subscriptions. Since RNA needs to see the first packet
of a session published from stream trackers, these modules (e.g., stream, stream_icmp,
stream_ip, stream_tcp, and stream_udp) should be enabled whenever RNA module is enabled.
